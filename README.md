# Well-structured README.md demonstrating DevOps principles and lifecycle stages

## 1. Foundational DevOps Concepts

- Define DevOps: DevOps increases a companies ability to deliver applications through ensuring that there's proper automation, good quality, proper monitoring and continous testing.
- Briefly explain the core principles
  1. Automation: Involves testing, deployment.
  2. Collaboration: Encourages shared responsibility for the entire software lifecycle.
  3. CI/CD: Ensuring automating code and making sure code is always in deployable state.
  4. Continous Deployment: Automating the release of code into production.
  5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Manages infrastructure using code and automation tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
  6. Monitoring: Implements real-time monitoring and logging for applications and infrastructure.

## 2. DevOps Lifecycle Stages

- Stages
  1. Planning: It ensures a clear understanding of what needs to be built and how success will be measured.
  2. Development: Developers write code based on the plan, using version control systems like Git.
  3. Building: The source code is compiled and packaged into deployable artifacts.
  4. Testing: Automated and manual tests are run to verify functionality, performance, and security.
  5. Release: A final, stable version of the application is prepared for deployment.
  6. Deployment: The application is deployed to production (or staging) environments using automated pipelines.
  7. Operation: It involves configuration management, provisioning, and infrastructure monitoring.
  8. Monitoring: Monitoring helps detect issues early and informs future improvements.
